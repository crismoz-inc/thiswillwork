This is a sort of resume site for me. I am a Code Louisville Participant and I wanted this website to be
a reflection of some of the skills I have learned. I wanted to include 
elements of Javascript, CSS and HTML. I will continue to add and make changes as my knowledge grows. I will continue to add updates to the site, as well as the readme. My site is a simple resume site. I have several CSS selectors and Javascript function. You can go to the navigation menu at the top, and scroll down. If you click the paragraph it changes colors. In addition, if you press the quote button, it will display a quote. At the bottom I have a comment box and footer. Any feedback is welcome.
