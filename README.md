This is a sort of resume site for me. I am a Code Louisville Participant and I wanted this website to be
a reflection of some of the skills I have learned. I wanted to include 
elements of Javascript, CSS and HTML. I will continue to add and make changes as my knowledge grows. I will continue to add updates to the site, as well as the readme. Any feedback is welcome.
